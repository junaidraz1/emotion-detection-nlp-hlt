"Margot Robbie's scene was touching, watching Sharon Tate watch herself.",3
The horror movies this year have been largely bad... and disappointing.,0
I love Reservoir Dogs. It made me want to study film.,3
It was a different friend of Tate's who encountered him... timelines don't match.,5
Margot Robbie watching Sharon Tate onscreen was one of my favorite moments.,3
It was boring as shit.,0
"I didn't like Midsommar, though I understand the praise on this one.",0
John Wick was pretty good. I'm happy the Mavs signed the assassin in the library.,2
Margaret Qualley was very entertaining in this. Kind of an underrated performance.,5
That's about 2 hours in.,5
You sound like a dunce.,0
"Didn't see MIB, Hellboy, or Dark Phoenix. They looked like trash.",0
It's that type of film though... Sprawling atmospheric character piece.,3
It had me thinking something was broken in the theatre.,1
She didn't feel like a fully fleshed out character... She was just there.,0
I apologize for being the movie going public at large.,4
Yesterday was a massive step back for Boyle.,0
Self indulgent in the same way Jackie Brown was... not enough plot and story.,0
I loved how Cliff was able to take down those guys. The climax was INSANE.,5
Pikachu was a waste of time.,0
I was so confused until I realized that she didn't know Sharon Tate was murdered.,5
Why do we let Tarantino get away with this shit? The constant use of the N-Word... it's fucking pathetic.,0
She didn't put together that 'Charlie' was Charles Manson.,5
I thought something happened to the movie in the theatre I was in.,1
"Partner, that's about 2 hours in.",2
They really did Bruce Lee dirty in this one.,4
I didn't like Aladdin either.,4
"I didn't like Toy Story 4, though I have a very strong TS3 bias.",5
That wasn't the point. Cliff didn't alter their path. Rick did.,0
Endgame was a good conclusion.,2
"Spider-Man was cool, if largely forgettable, outside of certain individual scenes.",2
I didn't like Lion King. I actually outright hate this one.,0
Us was great.,2
Awesome movie!,2
Captain Marvel was trash. A terrible screenplay.,0
Rocketman was great. Actually my favorite of the year by a long shot.,3
I thought that could have been him but I wasn't sure! I hope it was!,5
The ending totally caught me off guard.,5
This movie is awful and boring. At least Transformers was somewhat entertaining.,4
lol you need to watch more movies.,2
The climax was INSANE.,3
This was a blip on the radar compared to Tarantino's masterpieces.,0
No it fucking doesn't. Without that knowledge you're just watching nothing happen.,0
Glad you took the time to give us a detailed report to explain your disdain for the film.,3
I genuinely don't know if I'm just becoming overly cynical or this year has truly been bad.,4
It also seems like there was way more vintage product placement... but my memory doesn't really start until the early 1970s.,4
She (Tarantino fan) goes 'Well maybe he's going a different direction',2
You need to watch more movies if you think this was good.,1
"I am working, you're filling compilation time.",0
The girl Rick impresses on set is so goddamn good. Love that scene.,3
